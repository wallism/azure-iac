create a bicep template and powershell script to run it. Resources needed are:
appservice (free tier please), storage account and a user assigned managed identity (UAMI), this UAMI should be an identity assigned on the appservice and it should have blob contributor access on the storage account

# keyvault
that works, now add a keyvault named, dev-kv-azureiac-bicep-ause with a UAMI called dev-kv-azureiac-bicep-ause-uami. That UAMI should be assigned these roles on the keyvault, Reader and Keyvault Secrets User.

# secret
create a secret in the keyvault with name TestSecret and value of "mytestvalue"

# secret in bicep
please create the secret in the bicep

# warning
Warning use-parent-property: Resource "keyVaultSecret" has its name formatted as a child of resource "keyVault". The syntax can be simplified by using the parent property

# 'secrets' not valid
this isn't valid: resource keyVaultSecret 'secrets' 

# RBAC based keyvault
on the keyvault we want this access control activated: Azure role-based access control

# keyvault uami on appservice
please assign the keyvault uami to the appservice
